# Wikidata Graph

A Next.js application rendering a graph using D3.js on data retrieved from the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)-API.

In action at [http://wikidata.snater.com/](http://wikidata.snater.com/).

Inspired by the [Wikidata Graph Builder](https://github.com/AngryLoki/wikidata-graph-builder), which was built in CoffeeScript back then. I wanted to create a React version.
